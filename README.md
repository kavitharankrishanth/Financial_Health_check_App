# Financial_Health_check_App
INTRODUCTION :
In today’s world, businesses and organization rely on machine learning to make accurate predictions and informed decisions. Our ML project is designed to analyze various datasets and predict profit or loss values based on key features. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, our model can identify patterns, trends, and correlation within the data to provide precise financial forecasts.This project can be applied to various industries, including sales, stock market analysis, business finance, helping users make strategic decisions to maximize profits and minimize losses. Through data processing, feature selections, and model training, our system ensures high accuracy and reliability in predicting financial outcomes
STEPS TO BUILD THE MODEL :
•Python ( data analysis & modeling)
•Load & explore dataset (pandas, numpy)
•Data preprocessing (handle missing value, encode categories)
•Train the ML model( Random Forest Regressor )
•Evaluate performance ( accuracy, score)
•Deploy as web app(streamlit)
WORK FLOW :
•HOME TAB
                 This is the landing page of the app, contains an introduction to the purpose of the financial health check.
•SCORE TAB
                  CSV file uploader in the sidebar for importing financial data. And then it processing profit and loss calculated for each product. Data is cleaned, encoded and split for model training. Machine learning model Random Forest Regressor is  trained on the dataset. And the model performance evaluated using R Square .
•VISUALIZATION
              Uses seaborn to generate grouped bar plots .It helps to identify the most profits and losses by products.
